# Weather Data Visualization Dashboard

## Overview

This is a Streamlit-based weather data visualization dashboard that provides interactive weather analysis with real-time API integration. The application fetches current weather data and 5-day forecasts from the OpenWeatherMap API and presents the information through various visualizations including temperature trends, humidity levels, and other meteorological parameters. Users can input any city name to view comprehensive weather data with interactive charts and graphs.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Streamlit Framework**: Uses Streamlit as the primary web framework for creating the interactive dashboard interface
- **Component-Based Design**: Modular architecture with separate classes for weather API interactions, data processing, and visualizations
- **Caching Strategy**: Implements Streamlit's `@st.cache_resource` decorator for efficient resource management and performance optimization
- **Responsive Layout**: Wide layout configuration with expandable sidebar for user controls and configuration options

### Backend Architecture
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Separates concerns through dedicated service classes:
  - `WeatherAPI`: Handles all external API communications with OpenWeatherMap
  - `DataProcessor`: Manages data transformation and structuring
  - `WeatherVisualizations`: Creates and manages chart generation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for API failures, timeouts, and invalid responses
- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Structured data flow from API response to processed DataFrame for visualization

### Data Processing
- **Pandas Integration**: Uses pandas DataFrames for efficient data manipulation and analysis
- **Data Transformation**: Converts raw API JSON responses into structured, analyzable formats
- **Time Series Processing**: Handles datetime conversion and time-based data grouping for trend analysis
- **Statistical Calculations**: Processes daily temperature ranges, averages, and other meteorological statistics

### Visualization Engine
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Primary visualization libraries for creating weather charts and graphs
- **Multiple Chart Types**: Supports line charts for temperature trends and bar charts for daily temperature ranges
- **Interactive Elements**: Streamlit integration allows for dynamic chart updates based on user input
- **Styling and Formatting**: Consistent visual design with proper date formatting and responsive layouts

## External Dependencies

### Third-Party APIs
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Primary weather data source providing current weather and 5-day forecasts
  - Requires API key authentication via environment variable `OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY`
  - Supports metric units and city-based queries
  - Handles rate limiting and error responses

### Python Libraries
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for dashboard interface
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing support
- **Matplotlib**: Primary plotting library for static visualizations
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization enhancement
- **Requests**: HTTP library for API communications

### Environment Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: Uses `OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY` for secure API key management
- **Default Fallback**: Provides placeholder API key for development environments
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration through Streamlit's page config and sidebar controls
